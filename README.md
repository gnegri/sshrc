<h2>Installation</h2>

### Ubuntu (12.04 and 14.04 only):
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:russell-s-stewart/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sshrc
```

### Everything else:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnegri/sshrc/master/sshrc
chmod +x sshrc
sudo mv sshrc /usr/local/bin #or anywhere else on your PATH
```

<h2>Usage</h2>

sshrc works just like ssh, but it also sources the ~/.sshrc on your local computer after logging in remotely.

    $ echo "echo welcome" > ~/.sshrc
    $ sshrc me@myserver
    welcome

    $ echo "alias ..='cd ..'" > ~/.sshrc
    $ sshrc me@myserver
    $ type ..
    .. is aliased to `cd ..'

You can use this to set environment variables, define functions, and run post-login commands. It's that simple, and it won't impact other users on the server - even if they use sshrc too. This makes sshrc very useful if you share a server with multiple users and can't edit the server's ~/.bashrc without affecting them, or if you have several servers that you don't want to configure independently.

<h2>Advanced configuration</h2>

Your most import configuration files (e.g. vim, inputrc) may not be bash scripts. Put them in ~/.sshrc.d and sshrc will copy them to a (guaranteed) unique folder in the /tmp directory after login. You can find them on the sever at $SSHHOME/.sshrc.d

Once the config files are on the server, you can usually tell programs to load their configuration from the $SSHHOME/.sshrc.d directory by setting the right environment variables. For example, vim uses the VIM environment variable.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.sshrc.d
    $ echo ':imap <special> jk <Esc>' > ~/.sshrc.d/vimrc
    $ echo 'VIM=$SSHHOME/.sshrc.d' > ~/.sshrc
    $ sshrc me@myserver
    $ vim # jk -> normal mode will work
    
Putting too much data in ~/.sshrc.d will slow down your login times. If the folder contents are > 1MB, the server may start blocking your sshrc attempts.

If you use tmux frequently, you can make sshrc work there as well.

    $ echo 'SHELL=$SSHHOME/bashsshrc
      alias tmux="tmux -S /tmp/russelltmuxserver"
      alias foo="echo I work with tmux, too"' > ~/.sshrc
    $ sshrc me@myserver
    $ tmuxrussell
    $ foo
    I work with tmux, too

After the SHELL variable is set, any new tmux server will load your configurations. The -S option will start a separate tmux server at /tmp/russelltmuxserver. Don't try to access the vanilla tmux server when your SHELL environment variable is set: if the server isn't already running, other users will get your configurations with their own sessions.
